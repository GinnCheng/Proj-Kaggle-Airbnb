Joe was also very helpful in returning an earring to me that I had left in the room. Would definitely stay again.'\n",

I am a medical student and was studying at the Massachusetts General Hospital for 6 weeks so it was really important for me to find a place that was clean, private, comfortable, safe and friendly with easy access to Harvard Square/ the red line/ the hospital. Joe's place provided all of this and more! \\r\\n\\r\\nThe room was spacious and clean with air conditioning and a heater. I had easy access to all the facilities I needed including a fully equipped kitchen, laundry facilities and 2 bathrooms. Joe went above and beyond to make sure I had everything I needed and went out and bought an ironing board when I asked if one was available for me to iron my shirts with! All the guests that stayed during my 6 weeks were also respectful and friendly which made my trip even better. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe house is in a pleasant residential area which is quiet at night time but close to all important amenities. The nearest supermarket was only 10 minutes walk away and the number 66 bus route had a stop at the top of the road and had a regular service every 5-10 minutes which took me into Harvard Square within 10 minutes. \\r\\n\\r\\nBetween my excellent hosts and the fantastic location I felt completely at home during my stay and would recommend Joe's place to anyone looking visit Boston without paying the ridiculous price of downtown hotels. It was an absolute pleasure to get to know him and his wife Nancy and I hope they stay in touch in the future. I wish you both all the best! \"\n",
